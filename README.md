# Introduction
An open source Garry's Mod multiplayer game-mode. Originally created by Joeri van der Velden (Clavus) and later updated by (NECROSSIN). The game-mode has been featured in multiple magazines.
This open-source project aims to make the old 'GM12' code compatible with the latest Garry's Mod version.

# How to play
There's currently no public server. The [Mr. Green Gaming](https://mrgreengaming.com) community will launch a server once the code has stabilized.
For testing purposes it's possible to run this game-mode on Garry's Mod dedicated server. Listen servers are untested at this point.
